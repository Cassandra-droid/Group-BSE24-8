This is a simple web application that provides a platform for users to interact with a front end built using React and a back end built using Node.js

Start by cloning the project from GitHub to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git

Navigate into the project directory: cd repository-name
Once inside the project folder, install the necessary dependencies. If you are using Node.js, this can be done using: npm install

Set up version control using the following steps:

To start tracking your project using Git: git init

Stage and commit your files: git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

Link your project to a remote repository on GitHub (or GitLab, Bitbucket): git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/new-repo.git

Push your local commits to the remote repository: git push -u origin main

Make sure to update the repository regularly by committing any changes and pushing them to the remote repository: git add .
git commit -m "Updated feature X"
git push
